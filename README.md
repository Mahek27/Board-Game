# BoardGame
The goal of this project is to create a video game using the Unity Game Engine that resembles a
traditional tabletop “board game,” but in the virtual setting. The Unity Game Engine uses the
C# programming language, so Board Game will be written using this language. The
Board Game will look similar to a physical board game, such that it will have a path of
numbered spaces, a starting space, and an ending space. The user will control a small
character sprite and make their way across the board. The goal of this game is to complete
the Board Game by rolling a pair of dice in order to progress further along the board. The
catch is, with every roll, the user will need to complete a “minigame” in order to secure the
progression of their points. A minigame is a small game that the user will need to complete to
progress in the normal (macro) game. The player will collect points from the completion of
minigames, which will add to their total points. If the user reaches the end of the board, but
has not accumulated enough points, they will not be able to successfully complete the game.
The minigames will be of any variety of difficulty and scope, and the user will receive a
random minigame upon reaching each new space along the board. 
<p>The user will have a “top-down” view of the board as they move long it, meaning, they
will view their character sprite from above as the sprite moves along the board. The board’s
general interface will be in 2D, two dimensions, and will have the dice the user rolls in the
player’s “Heads Up Display” (HUD). After the user has rolled the dice, and the dice has given
the user a number, the player will move that many spaces along the board. Once they reach
this space, a minigame will be randomly selected and the user will be asked to complete this
game. If they fail to complete the task, they will stay on this space, but not receive any points for this loss. Although the general board is in two dimensions, it does not preclude us from
adding any 3D, three dimensional, games into the project.
We have added a variety of minigames, in both difficulty and scope, to the Board
throughout our work on the game. We have also added a few additional modes to our game
that change up the way the user plays the game. </p>
